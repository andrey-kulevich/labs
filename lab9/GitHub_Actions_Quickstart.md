## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

1. I added .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml file that contains jobs that should be done in response to some action (in my case it is `git push` command). This file can be found in this repository. It is interesting that we can use ready-to-use actions from github to perform some complex tasks.
2. Then I pushed a commit to github and waited until the process done.

I faced no errors, the process is pretty simple.


## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

1. I configured workflow with manual trigger in a new workflow .github/workflows/github-actions-manual-trigger.yml
2. I pushed new workflow and runned it manually in github.
3. I also added action to gather system info using kenchan0130/actions-system-info action.

Here are the results:
