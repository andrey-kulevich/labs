## Task 1: VM Deployment

1. Install VirtualBox:
   - Unfortunately there is no stable version of VB for M1 Mac with ARM architecture, so I tried to install beta version of VB from official site (**7.0.8_BETA4 r156879 (Qt6.3.0)**).
   - It works and I even tried to install Ubuntu 20.04 amd64, but got some fatal error and gave up. Lords from Ubuntu forum say that now this beta version of VB can run only Windows XP 32bit, no modern OS available. Ok, let's try other solutions...

2. Deploy a Virtual Machine:
   - Since VirtualBox does not work on M1 Mac yet (and I do not wanna pay for perfect working Parallels Desktop from AppStore), I found free app called **UTM**.
   - It worked! You can see the process in screenshots.

## Task 2: System Information Tools

1. Processor, RAM, and Network Information:
   - I used default System Monitor (see screenshot).
2. Operating System Specifications:
   - I used section ***About*** in Ubuntu Settings (see screenshot).
